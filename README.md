### Employees (per agency)
- Employees have permissions and profiles defined by: first and last name, email, phone, description, gender, photo, nationality, birth date, profession, biography, addresses, contact, role, and department.

## User Journey
1. The first user who creates the organization account becomes the admin and can invite other agency owners.
2. Each agency owner (tenant admin) can invite users in the agency, manage users/roles, manage tenant profile, and view an overview of their actions.
3. In an agency, roles are:
   - Technician: search parts, check stock, consume/issue parts.
   - Inventory manager: manage bins/locations, stock in/out/transfers, reconcile counts.
   - Procurement manager: manage suppliers, catalog/pricing, create/track purchase orders.
   - Analyst: analytics, KPIs, demand/usage trends.
4. A supplier is an existing organization within the application and can view incoming purchase orders and respond with pricing/lead time.
